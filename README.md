Recommendation systems are algorithms with an objective to suggest the most relevant information to users, whether that be similar products on Amazon, similar TV shows on Netflix, or similar songs on Spotify.

There are two main types of recommendation systems: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering :-

1. Content-based recommendation systems recommend particular items based on previously chosen itemsâ€™ features. For example, if I watched a lot of action movies previously, it would rank other action movies higher.
2. Collaborative filtering, on the other hand, filters items that a user might like based on the reactions of similar users. For example, if I liked Song A and someone else liked Song A and Song C, then I would be recommended Song C.
